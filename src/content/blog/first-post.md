Hi! My name is Salma! I'm a sophomore in highschool who's been coding since I was ~11 years old, so for about 3 years now. I first got into coding in order to create [bots](https://github.com/sa1l1/wmmapbot), but I eventually branched out into web & app development, blockchain, AI and more!

My interests *currently* lie in **Computer Science**, **Math**, and **Computational Linguistics**, with me competing in local competitions and national olympiads like [NACLO](https://naclo.org/) and [USACO](https://usaco.org/).

Thank you for visiting my blog and feel free to have a look at my [**projects**](https://www.salmaj.me/) :)
