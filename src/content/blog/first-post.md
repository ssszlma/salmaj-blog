Hi! My name is Salma! I'm a sophomore in highschool who's been coding since I was ~11 years old, so for about 3 years now. I first got into coding in order to create [bots](https://github.com/sa1l1/Jas.), but I eventually branched out into web/app development, blockchain, AI and more.

My interests lie in **Computer Science**, **Math**, and **Computational Linguistics**. 

I regularly attend local competitions and [**hackathons**](https://www.easya.io/events/easya-x-polkadot-hackathon-usa), and I also compete in national olympiads like [**NACLO**](https://naclo.org/) and [**USACO**](https://usaco.org/).

Thank you for visiting my blog and feel free to have a look at my [**projects**](https://www.salmaj.me/) !1!
